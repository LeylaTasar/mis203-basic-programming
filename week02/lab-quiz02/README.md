Week 02 Lab Quiz - Two-Item Purchase Quote
Test Runs
Standard Test Case: Tested with Item 1 (quantity = 2, unit price = 50), Item 2 (quantity = 1, unit price = 80), delivery fee = 20, and tax = 10%. The program calculated a subtotal of 180.00 TRY, tax of 18.00 TRY, and the expected final total of 218.00 TRY.
Boundary / Error Case (Stretch Task): Tested entering letters (abc) instead of a number for the quantity input. The program stopped with the following error message: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
How a later version could handle it: A future version could use a try-except ValueError block inside a while loop (or check .isdigit()) to catch invalid inputs and prompt the user to enter a valid integer without crashing the program.
What I Changed After Testing
After running the initial test, I updated the output formatting using :.2f in the f-strings so that all monetary values (unit prices, line totals, subtotal, tax, delivery fee, and final total) consistently display with two decimal places.
Why input() Must Be Converted Before Arithmetic
In Python, the input() function always returns user input as a text string (str). If we do not convert it using int() or float() before arithmetic operations, the + operator will concatenate strings instead of adding numbers, and multiplication/division operations will fail with a TypeError.
